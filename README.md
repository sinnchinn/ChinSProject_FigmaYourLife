// You will create a website including at least 3 pages about you (or a fictional character), your interests and accomplishments. It also has to include a landing page.
// Peer Review and Comments: Caleb Sylvia: The site was so simple but was so pleasing to go through, the colors were nice on the eyes and was easy to read. The pictures went so well with it and the accordian was very satisfying to go through. Amazing site and the font was very fitting for the theme.
